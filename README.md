## Description
This website was built to allow user to enter their age and calculate what your age would be on a different planet.

## Setup/Installation Requirement
* [Portfolio](https://github.com/kody7mm/)
* [Project Page](https://github.com/kody7mm/planetary-age)
* Can be cloned from [repository](https://github.com/kody7mm/planetary-age)

## Setup and Installation
* **Clone the repository** to a local directory using the command-line tool `git` ([how to install git](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/git-and-github)).  
  `$ cd ~/[directory]/[path]/[of]/[choice]/`  
  `$ git clone https://github.com/kody7mm/planetary-age.git`  

* **Navigate into the project** using `cd` to move to the top level of the project directory.  
  `$ cd planetary-age/`   

* **Install all application dependencies** using the `Node.js` package manager `npm`. You will need `Node.js` to be able to use `npm` ([how to install node and npm](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/getting-started-with-javascript/installing-node-js)).  
  `$ npm install`

* Then **build a distribution bundle** by running the following. This will create the version of `index.html` you will access as discussed a few points below.  
  `$ npm run build`

* **Run the full `Jest` test suite** to see all tests used in development, verify all *business logic* has 100% line coverage with these tests, and be confident all methods are behaving as expected.  
  `$ npm test`  

* To view the site locally, **start the preconfigured development server** to automatically launch the site in your default browser.  
  `$ npm run start`
  
  * You could also open the file called `index.html` in the project's `dist/` subdirectory to view a static version.  
  `$ cd dist/`  
  `$ open index.html`  

## Specs

## Known Bugs
* Design will be improved
* Improvements to floating could be implemented after more experience and practice is had.
